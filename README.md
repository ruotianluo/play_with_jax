My path to learn jax.

## A captioning model
[Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o7NvUogX9RYuAbSumQj6-_gg4rfjKCHB?usp=sharing). This is using flax. (The pytorch counterpart is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19FPeRi5DjNbqY8dtvo0gHS0K_pEnT2CW?usp=sharing))

<del>I will try to take a look at Haiku.</del> Haiku seems very similar to flax.linen.

Flax is pretty similar to tensorflow 1.0 I feel like.

I hate google just have all these different high-level packages from different places. flax, trax, haiku etc...... (Saw a discussion [here](https://twitter.com/MilesCranmer/status/1300394832515432449)).
