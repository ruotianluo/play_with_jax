# play_with_jax
My path to learn jax.

## A captioning model
[Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o7NvUogX9RYuAbSumQj6-_gg4rfjKCHB?usp=sharing). This is using flax.
I will try to take a look at Haiku.

Flax is pretty similar to tensorflow 1.0 I feel like.

I hate google just have all these different high-level packages from different places. flax, trax, haiku etc......
